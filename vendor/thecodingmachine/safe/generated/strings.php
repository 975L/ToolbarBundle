/**
 * Returns a string produced according to the formatting string
 * format.
 *
 * @param string $format The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
 * ordinary characters (excluding %) that are
 * copied directly to the result and conversion
 * specifications, each of which results in fetching its
 * own parameter.  This applies to both sprintf
 * and printf.
 *
 * Each conversion specification consists of a percent sign
 * (%), followed by one or more of these
 * elements, in order:
 *
 *
 *
 * An optional sign specifier that forces a sign
 * (- or +) to be used on a number. By default, only the - sign is used
 * on a number if it's negative. This specifier forces positive numbers
 * to have the + sign attached as well.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * An optional padding specifier that says
 * what character will be used for padding the results to the
 * right string size.  This may be a space character or a
 * 0 (zero character).  The default is to pad
 * with spaces.  An alternate padding character can be specified
 * by prefixing it with a single quote (').
 * See the examples below.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * An optional alignment specifier that says
 * if the result should be left-justified or right-justified.
 * The default is right-justified; a -
 * character here will make it left-justified.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * An optional number, a width specifier
 * that says how many characters (minimum) this conversion should
 * result in.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * An optional precision specifier in the form
 * of a period (.) followed by an optional decimal digit string
 * that says how many decimal digits should be displayed for
 * floating-point numbers. When using this specifier on a string,
 * it acts as a cutoff point, setting a maximum character limit to
 * the string. Additionally, the character to use when padding a
 * number may optionally be specified between the period and the
 * digit.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * A type specifier that says what type the
 * argument data should be treated as.  Possible types:
 *
 *
 * % - a literal percent character. No
 * argument is required.
 *
 *
 * b - the argument is treated as an
 * integer and presented as a binary number.
 *
 *
 * c - the argument is treated as an
 * integer and presented as the character with that ASCII
 * value.
 *
 *
 * d - the argument is treated as an
 * integer and presented as a (signed) decimal number.
 *
 *
 * e - the argument is treated as scientific
 * notation (e.g. 1.2e+2).
 * The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the
 * decimal point since PHP 5.2.1. In earlier versions, it was taken as
 * number of significant digits (one less).
 *
 *
 * E - like %e but uses
 * uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
 *
 *
 * f - the argument is treated as a
 * float and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware).
 *
 *
 * F - the argument is treated as a
 * float and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware).
 * Available since PHP 5.0.3.
 *
 *
 * g - shorter of %e and
 * %f.
 *
 *
 * G - shorter of %E and
 * %f.
 *
 *
 * o - the argument is treated as an
 * integer and presented as an octal number.
 *
 *
 * s - the argument is treated as and
 * presented as a string.
 *
 *
 * u - the argument is treated as an
 * integer and presented as an unsigned decimal number.
 *
 *
 * x - the argument is treated as an integer
 * and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase
 * letters).
 *
 *
 * X - the argument is treated as an integer
 * and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase
 * letters).

 *
 * Attempting to use a combination of the string and width specifiers with character sets that require more than one byte per character may result in unexpected results
 *
 * The format string supports argument numbering/swapping.  Here is an
 * example:
 *
 * Argument swapping
 *
 *
 * ]]>
 *
 *
 * This will output "There are 5 monkeys in the tree".  But
 * imagine we are creating a format string in a separate file,
 * commonly because we would like to internationalize it and we
 * rewrite it as:
 *
 * Argument swapping
 *
 *
 * ]]>
 *
 *
 * We now have a problem.  The order of the placeholders in the
 * format string does not match the order of the arguments in the
 * code.  We would like to leave the code as is and simply indicate
 * in the format string which arguments the placeholders refer to.
 * We would write the format string like this instead:
 *
 * Argument swapping
 *
 *
 * ]]>
 *
 *
 * An added benefit here is that you can repeat the placeholders without
 * adding more arguments in the code.  For example:
 *
 * Argument swapping
 *
 *
 * ]]>
 *
 *
 * When using argument swapping, the n$
 * position specifier must come immediately
 * after the percent sign (%), before any other
 * specifiers, as shown in the example below.
 *
 * Specifying padding character
 *
 *
 * ]]>
 *
 * The above example will output:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Position specifier with other specifiers
 *
 *
 * ]]>
 *
 * The above example will output:

 *
 * The above example will output:

 * The above example will output:
